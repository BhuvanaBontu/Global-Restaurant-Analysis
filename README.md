# 🥗Global-Restaurant-Analysis
A comprehensive end to end data analysis project using Python for data cleaning and statistical modeling, and Tableau for interactive geographical and performance storytelling of the global restaurant market.
## Project Overview
The Project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of a restaurant dataset to understand market trends, customer preferences, and operational insights across various cities and countries. By combining Python for data processing and statistical analysis with Tableau for interactive visualization, the project provides a data-driven look at the global restaurant industry. 

## Project Objective
